## Contributing Issues

### Before Submitting an Issue
First, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. If there is an issue add your comments to this issue.

The Code project is distributed across multiple repositories, try to file the issue against the correct repository [Related Projects](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects).

If your issue is a question then please ask the question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) using the tag `vscode`. 

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request, do not file combo issues.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:

* Provide reproducable steps, what the result of the steps was, an what you would have expected.
* Description of what you expect to happen
* Animated GIFs
* Code that demonstrates the issue
* Version of VS Code
* Errors in the Dev Tools Console (Help | Toggle Developer Tools)
* When you have extensions installed, can you reproduce the issue when starting vscode without extensions by using the `--disable-extensions` command line argument?
